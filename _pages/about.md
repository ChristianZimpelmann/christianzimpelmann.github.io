I am a Research Associate at [IZA](https://www.iza.org/person/28688/christian-zimpelmann). My research is on the intersection of behavioral economics, labor economics, and household finance. I am interested in the determinants of labor supply and financial decision of households and how those choices depend on the institutional environment. For my projects, I make use of both self-collected survey data and administrative data sets.

I co-coordinate IZA's program area "Gender and Family". I am a core maintainer for [GETTSIM](https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim) (GErman Taxes and Transfer SIMulator).
