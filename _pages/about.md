<!-- [University of Hamburg](https://www.iza.org/person/28688/christian-zimpelmann) -->
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Hamburg since 2024. After finishing my PhD at the University of Bonn in 2021, I was a postdoc at IZA, where I still am an associated member. In May 2023, I visited the University of Oxford.

[//]: # My research is on the intersection of labor economics, behavioral economics, and household finance.

I am interested in labor supply and financial decision of households, with a particular focus on the behavioral foundations underlying these choices and how they are influenced by the institutional environment. Methodologically, I use advanced econometric and computational methods and utilize both self-collected survey data and large-scale administrative data sets.

[//]: # I enjoy working on complex research projects that require advanced computational skills and state-of-the-art data science techniques.

I have made significant contributions to the development of [GETTSIM](https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim), an open-source model of the German tax and transfer system which I apply in my research.

Please reach out to me if you would like to talk about my or your research!

[//]: # I apply GETTSIM in both my research and a project commissioned by the German Ministry of Family Affairs on the effects of a new basic child security (Kindergrundsicherung).

On the following pages, you find my [ongoing research projects](ongoing-research), my [publications](publications), and my [CV](cv).
