I am a Research Associate at [IZA](https://www.iza.org/person/28688/christian-zimpelmann). My research is on the intersection of labor economics, behavioral economics, and household finance. Specifically, I am interested in labor supply and financial decision of households. I focus on the understanding of behavioral foundations of these choices and how they depend on the institutional environment. 

For my projects, I use a range of advanced econometric methods and utlilize both self-collected survey data and administrative data sets. I enjoy working on complex research projects that require advanced computational skills and state-of-the-art data science techniques. 

I made significant contributions to the development of [GETTSIM](https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim), an open-source model of the German tax and transfer system. I apply GETTSIM in both my research and a project commissioned by the German Ministry of Family Affairs on the effects of a new basic child security (Kindergrundsicherung).

On the following pages, you find my [publications](publications), my [ongoing research projects](ongoing-research), and my [CV](cv).
