I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [IZA](https://www.iza.org/person/28688/christian-zimpelmann) after finishing my PhD at the University of Bonn in 2021. In May 2023, I visted the University of Oxford. I am on the 2023/2024 academic job market.

We examine the influence of gender role attitudes, specifically views about the appropriate role of mothers, on post-childbirth employment decisions. German panel data reveals that mothers with traditional attitudes are 15% less likely to work during early motherhood than their egalitarian counterparts. Among working mothers, those with traditional attitudes work four hours less per week, and these differences persist for at least seven years. Fathers' attitudes also predict maternal labor supply, highlighting joint decision-making within couples. Examining the interaction of attitudes with changes in economic incentives, we find that the introduction of a cash-for-care payment for parents who abstain from using public childcare substantially reduced the labor supply of traditional mothers, whereas egalitarian mothers' labor supply remains unaffected. Moreover, a structural life-cycle model of female labor supply demonstrates that labor supply elasticities are substantially larger for traditional mothers while a counterfactual policy facilitating full-time childcare access has a more pronounced effect on egalitarian mothers. The findings stress that gender role attitudes can mediate the effects of policies, which implies that measured average policy effects cannot easily be transferred to other contexts, e.g., over time or to other countries, without accounting for differences in attitudes.

[//]: # My research is on the intersection of labor economics, behavioral economics, and household finance.

I am interested in labor supply and financial decision of households, particularly aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the behavioral foundations underlying these choices and how they are influenced by the institutional environment. For my projects, I use advanced econometric and computational methods and utlilize both self-collected survey data and administrative data sets.

[//]: # I enjoy working on complex research projects that require advanced computational skills and state-of-the-art data science techniques.

I have made significant contributions to the development of [GETTSIM](https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim), an open-source model of the German tax and transfer system which I apply in my research.

Please reach out to me if you would like to talk about my or your research!

[//]: # I apply GETTSIM in both my research and a project commissioned by the German Ministry of Family Affairs on the effects of a new basic child security (Kindergrundsicherung).
