I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [IZA](https://www.iza.org/person/28688/christian-zimpelmann). I finished my PhD at the University of Bonn in 2021 and visted the University of Oxford in May 2023. I am on the 2023/2024 academic job market.

[//]: # My research is on the intersection of labor economics, behavioral economics, and household finance.

I am interested in labor supply and financial decision of households, particularly aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the behavioral foundations underlying these choices and how they are influenced by the institutional environment. For my projects, I use advanced econometric and computational methods and utlilize both self-collected survey data and administrative data sets.

[//]: # I enjoy working on complex research projects that require advanced computational skills and state-of-the-art data science techniques.

I have made significant contributions to the development of [GETTSIM](https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim), an open-source model of the German tax and transfer system which I apply in my research.

Please reach out to me if you would like to talk about my or your research!

[//]: # I apply GETTSIM in both my research and a project commissioned by the German Ministry of Family Affairs on the effects of a new basic child security (Kindergrundsicherung).

    We examine the influence of gender role attitudes, referring to views about the appropriate role of mothers, on parents' labor supply decisions following childbirth. Using German panel data, we show that mothers with traditional gender attitudes are 15\% less likely to work and work four hours less during early motherhood than their egalitarian counterparts, with these differences being highly persistent. Fathers' attitudes are similarly important, emphasizing joint decision-making within couples. Furthermore, we examine how gender role attitudes mediate the effect of changes in economic incentives by looking at the introduction of a cash-for-care payment for parents who abstain from using public childcare. The policy reduced traditional mothers' labor supply substantially, but not labor supply of egalitarian mothers. To quantify how incentives and attitudes jointly shape labor supply decisions and to simulate counterfactual changes in economic incentives and gender attitudes, we estimate a life-cycle model of female labor supply. The findings underscore that gender role attitudes are of first-order importance for maternal labor supply decisions and can mediate the effects of policies.
